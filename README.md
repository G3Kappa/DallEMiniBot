# Dall-E Mini Bot

Automates all the tedious clicking.

## Q: How do I use this?

A: Type anything you wish to see generated by DALL-E and hit enter. You should receive a windows toast (notification) signaling the status of your request.

You can also type `!workers` to see the status of all requests, and `!max_workers <number>` to set the number of maximum concurrent requests.

If you want to know the list of all commands type `!help`.

## Q: What does this look like?

## Q: Why the toast notifications?

A: They show you a preview picture that you can click on to immediately highlight that file in the output folder.

## Q: Any technical tips?

Sometimes a request is left hanging in the "running" state for too long despite not failing.
To set a maximum timeout before a worker is killed and its request re-enqueued, use `!retry_timeout <seconds>`.

Note that setting a timeout that's lower than DALL-E's generation time **will cause issues**. 
Make sure that your timeout is about double the average response time, which, at the moment, averages 150 seconds.
